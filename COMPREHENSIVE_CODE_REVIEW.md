## üîí Security Analysis

### ‚úÖ Excellent Security Practices

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
   - Comprehensive PostgreSQL RLS policies enforced
   - User/organization data isolation properly implemented
   - Session GUCs for current user/org/role context
   - **Location:** `db_policies/migrations/0001_rls.py` and subsequent migrations

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Strict CSP headers in production
   - Environment-driven allow-lists for scripts/styles/connections
   - No inline styles by default (emergency escape hatch available)
   - **Location:** `app/middleware.py:SecurityHeadersMiddleware`

3. **Input Sanitization**
   - Multi-layer sanitization for AI prompts and user inputs
   - Control character removal and injection pattern neutralization
   - URL validation with scheme restrictions
   - **Location:** `ai/sanitize.py`

4. **Rate Limiting & Quotas**
   - Comprehensive AI endpoint protection via `@ai_protected` decorator
   - Tier-based rate limiting (free/pro/enterprise)
   - Plan gating for premium features
   - **Location:** `ai/decorators.py`

5. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - OAuth-only authentication (Google, GitHub, Facebook)
   - JWT-based session management
   - Proper permission classes and auth guards
   - **Location:** `accounts/` module

### üî∂ Security Recommendations

1. **Consolidate Quota Enforcement**
   ```python
   # Issue: Duplicate enforcement in middleware and permission classes
   # Recommendation: Remove QuotaEnforcementMiddleware or mark deprecated
   # Location: billing/middleware.py vs ai/decorators.py
   ```

2. **Enhanced Memory Model Security**
   - Consider implementing memory snippet access controls
   - Add encryption for sensitive AI memory data
   - **Location:** `ai/models.py:AIMemory`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strong Architectural Patterns

1. **Clean Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear module boundaries (accounts, billing, orgs, proposals, ai, exports, files)
   - Proper Django app organization
   - React component separation with lazy loading

2. **Async Task Architecture**
   - Celery integration for long-running AI operations
   - Proper job status tracking and error handling
   - **Location:** `ai/tasks.py`

3. **Provider Pattern**
   - Pluggable AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini, local)
   - Clean abstraction layer
   - **Location:** `ai/provider.py`

4. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Code splitting with React.lazy()
   - Proper routing and auth guards
   - Clean API abstraction layer
   - **Location:** `web/src/main.jsx`

### üî∂ Architectural Concerns

1. **Data Model Duplication Risk**
   ```python
   # Issue: Legacy Proposal.content vs new ProposalSection model
   # Recommendation: Define clear migration path to sections-first approach
   # Impact: Risk of stale data sync between models
   ```

2. **Revision Logic Centralization**
   ```python
   # Issue: Revision logic scattered across multiple locations
   # Recommendation: Centralize in single service class
   # Files: ai/tasks.py, proposals/models.py
   ```

## üß™ Code Quality Analysis

### ‚úÖ High Code Quality Standards

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - **Frontend:** 30/30 tests passing (100% pass rate)
   - **Backend:** Extensive pytest-django test suite
   - **Coverage:** Good test coverage with appropriate `pragma: no cover` usage (71 instances)

2. **Linting & Code Standards**
   - **Python:** Ruff linter configured (clean output)
   - **JavaScript:** ESLint configured (clean output)
   - **Configuration:** `pyproject.toml`, `.eslintrc.json`

3. **Type Safety**
   - Python type hints used throughout
   - TypeScript configuration for frontend
   - Proper typing for API responses

4. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   # Excellent pattern from ai/views.py
   try:
       res = provider.revise(...)
   except Exception:
       logger.exception('AI provider.revise failed')
       return Response({'error': 'ai_provider_error'}, status=502)
   ```

### üî∂ Code Quality Improvements

1. **Schema Migration Coordination**
   - Some migration conflicts resolved (e.g., `0011_conflict` merges)
   - Consider more granular migration strategy for complex changes

2. **Magic Numbers**
   ```python
   # Consider extracting to constants
   REVISION_CAP_DEFAULT = 5
   MAX_FILE_REFS_PER_REQUEST = 5
   MAX_OCR_TEXT_LENGTH = 20000
   ```
