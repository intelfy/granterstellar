# Refactor Baseline (Phase 0)

Date: (auto)

## Test Baseline

- Core backend suites (accounts, billing, exports, orgs, etc.): 29 tests PASS, 0 failures, 0 skips.
- AI suite: (historical snapshot) â€” Rate limiting feature has since been implemented via `ai_protected` decorator; legacy skip reference removed.

## Lint Baseline

- Python (ruff): Clean (no errors after correcting malformed test file). Goal: remain clean after each refactor phase.

## Historical Note

Original baseline captured prior to consolidating gating + rate limiting into a unified decorator. Document retained for audit only; current authoritative behavior lives in `docs/ai_rate_limiting.md`.

## Integrity Notes

- No production code modified; only test file structural fixes + skip decorator.
- Establishes objective metric for regression tracking: All existing functionality passes with 1 acknowledged pending feature test.

## Next Steps (Phase 1)

1. Frontend lint baseline capture.
2. Mechanical cleanup: unused imports, dead/commented code, stray prints.
3. Re-run full test + lint after each cleanup cluster.

## Activation Criteria for Next Phases

Proceed to structural reorganization only after maintaining green tests for two consecutive mechanical cleanup commits.
