# UI Selectors (Alias)

FILE_TYPE: 'FRONTEND_SELECTOR_ALIAS'
INTENDED_READER: 'AI_AGENT'
PURPOSE: ['Provide stable alias to UI selectors doc', 'Prevent broken links referencing style-docs.md', 'Maintain backward compatibility for docs references']
PRIORITY: 'LOW'
[[/AI_CONFIG]]

This file exists as a stable alias because multiple documents referenced `docs/style-docs.md` while the canonical selectors document is `frontend_design_bible.md`.

Canonical source: `frontend_design_bible.md` (see that file for the full selector map and guidance).

If you update selectors or add new test IDs/classes, update `frontend_design_bible.md` — not this alias. You may optionally append a short note here pointing to the new section if discoverability helps.
