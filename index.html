          <h2>Stepâ€‘byâ€‘step, without the overwhelm</h2>
          <p>If there is one thing - in our humble experience - small companies and non-profits just do not have the manpower to do, it's the rigamarole of grant writing. As an unfortunate consequence, many startups and deserving NGOs simply do not get access to all the funding they may be entitled to, because the process of applying for it is often so exhausting the time is better spent elsewhere.</p><br />
          <p>We think that's some bull. So we are here to help small teams, non-profits and startups ace their grant writing without sacrificing endless hours trying to perfect their grant proposals for ten different formats. With Granterstellar, you simply answer a few focused questions per section - or reuse old ones from previous proposals. We turn those into a clear, cohesive draft you can review and approve as you go.</p><br />
          <p>We use a combination of deterministic forms and generative AI to make sure your proposal is tailored to the exact grant you're applying for. When you're happy with it, it's as simple as clicking "export" and choosing your format.</p>

          <h2>Made for teams</h2>
          <p>We know no one person is an island. Grant proposals are a collaborative effort involving every layer of the organization, and they benefit from a wide range of inputs. But the process has to be quick and painless. So we built for that.</p><br />
          <p>With Granterstellar, you can invite your teammates to review your proposal drafts, see changes at a glance, and keep the proposals flowing. Our software is built with organizationâ€‘aware access so you can share everything you need to, as quickly as you want to, while keeping your organization's data completely safe and in your hands.</p>

          <p>Need a markdown file? We got you covered. A .docx so you can make the final few changes locally? No problem! Or maybe you're good to go and would really just like the final PDF? We can handle that too, just leave it to us. All you'll have to do is send it off!</p>
